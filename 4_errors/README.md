# Errors in LaCour-Little et al. (2022)

The code 01_dataset_analysis.R analyzes the errors of the critique. It generates three outputs:

1. The table of the miscoding of hurricane treatment years.
2. The figures showing that such miscoding peaks at the conforming loan limit for some hurricanes.
3. The formal RD test of the peak of miscoding at the conforming loan limit.

The snapshot of their data archive in March 2023 is stored at [this link.](https://www.ouazad.com/paper/lacour_little_data_archive.zip).

For readers who might not have the space to download their archive, we also store here the CSV file generated by their code in the folder, at the following link: [originated_05_CT_treatment.csv](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pkdlz69pwyige1p/originated_05_CT_treatment.csv?dl=1).

This produces the following table.
